## Ongoing Project

- **Deep Learning Framework Based Color Transfer for Fashion Apparel Implementation**
- Supervised by [Prof.Kim Yiu](https://www.scholarmate.com/P/iQrQNj) .

<br>In the ever-changing world of fashion, color migration plays a vital role in ensuring the appeal and attractiveness of apparel. Our project aims to implement a deep learning framework that facilitates color migration in fashion apparel, thereby enhancing the versatility and adaptability of designs.

## Early Project


**Implementation of sketch-based algorithm for garment image generation**<br>

<br>In an undergraduate mentor project, garment images were generated using garment texture patches and sketch outlines. Multiple papers such as styleGAN and other cutting edge deep learning models were called based on Linux during the thesis implementation to implement the data processing and some of the image algorithms.

<br>Technology selection: Python, Pytorch, Linux, Deep Learning, Image Algorithms.

<br>**Haier Home Appliances KV Products Indian Style Background Image Generation Workflow**<br>

<img src="\images\publications\haier.png" class="floatpic" width="260" height="180" style="float: right;">

<br>This project aims to develop a set of industrial-grade standardized AI for Haier Home Appliances series product effect images for the Indian market
Workflow. I completed data labeling for several home appliances and trained separate SDXL-based background
lora.

<br>I have independently developed the Haier home appliance workflow and home appliance set length drawing workflow, summarized the efficient project prompt template, and the straight-out KV drawing rate is as high as 75%.

<br>In the second phase of the project, independently developed Flux-based man-machine light and shadow interaction workflow, with the ability to perfect the drawing.

<br>Technology selection: ComfyUI, image algorithm, AIGC, Stable Diffusion, Flux.
