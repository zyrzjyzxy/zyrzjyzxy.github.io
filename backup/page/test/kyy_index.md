## Research Interests

- Natural Language Process
- Computer Vision

My current research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the **Deep Learning(CV & NLP)** and its applications in the real world. In a word, advanced technologies like Deep Learning positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my effort to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
